Diabetes Prediction and Recommendation System
Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Diabetes Prediction and Recommendation System built using Machine Learning (ML) and enhanced with a Large Language Model (LLM) integration. The application predicts diabetes risk based on user inputs and provides personalized recommendations for health improvement using a Streamlit web interface.

The project is designed to deliver accurate diabetes risk predictions and actionable recommendations, offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface for medical professionals and individuals.

Features
Diabetes Prediction:

Uses an ensemble of machine learning models trained on diverse datasets.
Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided health information.
Personalized Recommendations:

Integrates the Ollama LLM for generating personalized health advice.
Recommends lifestyle changes tailored to individual risk profiles.
User-Friendly Interface:

Built with Streamlit for easy accessibility and real-time predictions.
Production Ready:

Modular codebase with structured folders and clean dependency management.
Key Features in the Repository
Machine Learning Models:

Pretrained models for diabetes prediction.
Optimized for accuracy and performance.
Streamlit Application:

Frontend to collect user input and display predictions/recommendations.
LLM Integration:

Recommendation system powered by the Ollama model for personalized advice.
